# Portfolio-Game ðŸŽ²ï¿½
Interactive python game where you try to pick stock weights to achieve the tangency portfolio with the best Sharpe ratio.

This is a Python game where you test your investing intuition against Modern Portfolio Theory.  

- Pick a number between 2 and 10.
- These many stocks will be randomly selected for you from the top 20 global companies.  
- Guess your portfolio weights for these stocks that would maximise risk-adjusted return (Round 1, blind).
- See the stock performances over time and adjust your guess as you see fit (Round 2, seen).
- Compare your guesses against the **optimal tangency portfolio** (weights and performance).
